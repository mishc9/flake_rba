# Python project template for quick start 

> Based on this great [mCoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhUpxWjOhME) 
video.

This package should be used for quick start of the python projects with 
templates for automated tests and gitlab actions.  
To use it, change the name from `py_template` to the actual one everywhere in
the project, add/remove python versions and update configs if required.

*(I hope it would reduce a burden of boilerplate code and time required to 
start a python project)*

Uses `pytest` and `tox` for automated testing in `github` ci.
Contains all necessary configuration files.

No proper code or test examples included.
